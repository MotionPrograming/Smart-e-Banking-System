## 📂 Database Design

**Users Table**

* `user_id` (Primary Key)
* `username`
* `email`
* `password_hash`
* `role` (Admin / Customer / Auditor)
* `2fa_enabled` (Boolean)

**Accounts Table**

* `account_id` (Primary Key)
* `user_id` (Foreign Key)
* `account_type` (Savings / Checking)
* `balance`
* `status` (Active / Inactive)

**Transactions Table**

* `transaction_id` (Primary Key)
* `from_account`
* `to_account`
* `amount`
* `timestamp`
* `transaction_type` (Transfer / Deposit / Withdrawal)
* `description`

**Notifications Table**

* `notification_id` (Primary Key)
* `user_id` (Foreign Key)
* `message`
* `is_read` (Boolean)
* `created_at`

## 🚀 Workflow

1. User logs in and receives a JWT token.
2. User performs operations such as viewing accounts or transferring funds.
3. Backend validates requests, processes transactions, and updates the database.
4. Real-time notifications are pushed to the user’s frontend via WebSocket.
5. Scheduled jobs compute interests and fees, triggering notifications.
6. Users and admins access detailed reports and analytics dashboards.

## 📑 Expected Outcomes

* A highly secure, responsive, and scalable digital banking platform.
* Real-time interaction between users and backend services for instant updates.
* Comprehensive transaction management with full audit trails.
* Intuitive dashboards enabling data-driven decision making.
* Deployment-ready architecture suitable for cloud or on-premises environments.
