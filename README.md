### Core Tables Structure
```sql
Users: user_id, username, email, password_hash, role, 2fa_enabled, created_at
Accounts: account_id, user_id, account_type, balance, status, created_at
Transactions: transaction_id, from_account, to_account, amount, type, timestamp
Notifications: notification_id, user_id, message, is_read, created_at
